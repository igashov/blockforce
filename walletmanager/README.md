# WalletManager

Web application that shows balances of wallets via Blockchain API.
There is one big problem: I can't get the API Key: https://api.blockchain.info/customer/signup
If someone fortunately gets this key, he will be able to use this web application (I hope, everything will work well (I can't check it because I don't have the key :D )).

Usage:

- ```sh
    $ npm intall
    $ node index.js <API Code>
    ```

- Open hhtp://localhost:3000
- Input Wallet ID and Password 
- I suppose you should see balances of this Wallet (Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash and Ethereum)
